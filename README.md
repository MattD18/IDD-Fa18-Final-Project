# IDD-Fa18-Final-Project  

Project by Matthew Dalton

Project Idea: A smart mirror that recognizes and logs the clothes you that you are wearing.


## Paper Prototype

Rough form:

Expected parts:  
  Wood Frame  
  Mirror (Preferably One Way)  
  Camera (Preferably Raspberry Pi Camera)  
  Small Screen (LED vs LCD TBD)  
  Batteries  
  
 
Interaction plan: The main points of interaction will be an accompanying website/mobile application and a well defined interaction pattern (hopefully triggered by facial recognition) that is guided by the display on the mirror.

Object Detection Pipeline:


To Do:  
  Place mirror behind camera  
  Train clothing recognition neural net
  Design interatction/Create display
